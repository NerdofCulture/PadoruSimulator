Padoru Simulator

Hello there

Padoru Simulator is spread over two zip files: one containing what's needed to run the program, the other containing the data. 
Put them both into one folder and unzip them. That should work. 

Controls: 
a,d,w,s: movement
e: fire weapon
space: pause

Padoru Simulator is made by Nerd_of_Culture. However, assets may be derived from other people's artwork.
