Padoru Simulator

Hello there

Padoru Simulator is spread over two zip files: one containing what's needed to run the program, the other containing the data. 
Unzip and put them (the Data folder and the other folders and files) into one folder. That should work. 

There have been two builds released: 
- v3 contains the original build  
- v4 contains the original build + a Holo DLC 

Controls:   
a,d,w,s: movement;  
e: fire weapon;  
space: pause;  

Disclaimer: 
Padoru Simulator is made by Nerd_of_Culture. However, assets may be derived from other people's artwork.
