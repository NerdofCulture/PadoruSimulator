Padoru Simulator

Hello there

Padoru Simulator is spread over two zip files: one containing what's needed to run the program, the other containing the data. 
Unzip and put them (the Data folder and the other folders and files) into one folder. That should work. (It might be possible that "Padoru Simulator_(versionnumber) Data" needs to be renamed to "Padoru Simulator_Data" but it seems like it works without this.)

There have been two builds released (for Windows): 
- v3 contains the original build  
- v4 contains the original build + a Holo DLC   
- v5 contains v4 + a bug fix and minor upgrades   
- v6 is the last build (for now) which contains minor upgrades and additional characters. 

As for Mac, I have made an attempt at making it available, but there's no guarantee it'll work:       
Take the two Mac folders, and unzip them. Put the unzipped Resources in the unzipped Contents folder (you might need to rename them to just "Resources" and "Contents"). Then put the unzipped Content folder in a folder that ends with ".app". I won't be able to tell you if that'll work as hoped since I don't have a Mac, so if it doesn't I'm sorry. The most recent build, v2, should contain the same as the v6 build for Windows. 

Controls:   
a,d,w,s: movement;  
e: fire weapon;  
space: pause;
